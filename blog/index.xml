      <description>Valt = Security + Usability   At Valt we know that usability is essential to security. An impenetrable encryption protocol doesn’t help anybody out if nobody uses it. That’s why we designed Valt Passwords from the ground up to both protect and delight. It starts with your first experience using Valt. Instead of authenticating with a text-based password that’s either hard to remember or easy to guess, we use images.</description>

      <description>Valt Passwords challenges you to beat us at our own new game. When you play a round, we display a randomized grid of Valt&amp;rsquo;s curated images. In each row, exactly one of the images is yours. The goal is to accurately select your image as fast as possible from each row. We&amp;rsquo;ll time you. Our intern, John Karabinos, can do it in 15.13 seconds. If you can beat him&amp;mdash;or even come close&amp;mdash;tweet in our direction with the #beatjohn tag!</description>

      <description>Dual-Coding Theory 100 years ago in a galaxy not so far away, humans discovered that remembering images is easier and faster than remembering text. Despite this fact, billions of online accounts are guarded by strings of letters. To make matters worse, we are constantly advised to choose unique, long, and random character strings that are impossible to remember, one for each of our online accounts. Twenty years ago, researchers showed that more than 27% of people forget their passwords regularly and more than 81% of people forget one or more of their online passwords at least once.</description>

      <title>What Makes an Image Memorable?</title>

      <description>What Makes An Image Memorable?   Many believe memorability is subjective – i.e. the same Facebook pictures will stand out for some but fade away for others. Yet decades of research have proven this false. The ability of an image to stick with someone over time is actually a function of its subject(s) and composition.
Studies show we remember images in proportion to how distinct they are. Strange, counterintuitive pictures will make an impact—e.</description>

      <description>Introducing Valt   You shop online, you pay your taxes online, you order food online and you talk to your friends online. Let’s face it, the details of your life are stored online.
Now ask yourself, how many online accounts do you have? Is it 20? 30? 50? You might be surprised, but on average people have almost 140 accounts online and by 2020 it will exceed 200. That’s a boatload of usernames and passwords.</description>

      <description>Recognition Memory   Take a quick look at the six images below.
  Now go back and imagine a single word description for each one. Really, do it. Let me guess, Dancer, Wedding, Sunflower, Owls, Camera, Street. Okay, five out of six ain&amp;rsquo;t bad.
At Valt, we know that humans are extraordinarily good at recognizing images they’ve seen before. In fact, this is one reason Valt is so secure.</description>

      <description>Simpler Security: Single and Personalized Grids   Valt’s fundamental design philosophy is simple: security products must be usable to be effective.

In support of this guiding principle, we’re pleased to announce two new changes to Valt&amp;mdash;single grid authentication and personalized grids.
Single Grid Authentication New Valt users will now unlock using a single grid. You can either construct a grid using your own images (see below for more details) or you can use our curated set.</description>
