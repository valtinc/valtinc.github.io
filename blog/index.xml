      <description>Introducing Valt  With Valt, pictures are your passwords.   You shop online, you pay your taxes online, you order food online and you talk to your friends online. Letâ€™s face it, the details of your life are stored online.
Now ask yourself, how many online accounts do you have? Is it 20? 30? 50? You might be surprised, but on average people have almost 140 accounts online and by 2020 it will exceed 200.</description>

      <description>The Power of Recognition Memory Take a quick look at the six images below.
 Now go back and imagine a single word description for each one. Really, do it. Say it out loud, even. You won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed.
Now, it may come as a surprise, but humans are freakishly good at recognizing images they&amp;rsquo;ve seen before. In fact, this is one reason Valt is so secure. We generate a random text-based password for you and then use your innate ability to recognize images to translate that password into a set of images.</description>
