      <description>Backing up and Syncing your Valt Backup and syncing works by storing your encrypted Valt in the Valt cloud. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, not only is the Valt cloud safe, but your data is guarded by your images and by your Valt secret, which is like a booster shot of security. If you have multiple devices, syncing securely and efficiently propagates changes in your local Valt to other authorized clients through the Valt cloud.</description>

      <description>Restoring your Valt You can restore a Valt by either using your Valt secret (this is common when you only have a single device) or by reauthorizing a device if you are currently syncing and have access to device that was previously authorized.
