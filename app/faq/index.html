<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<h4 id="what-is-valt">What is Valt?</h4>

<p>Valt is a new approach to password management&mdash;one that is visual and fun&mdash;and gives you the freedom to surf without worry or distraction.  We use NSA-approved encryption to securely lock your data behind a truly random master password. But here’s the thing&mdash;your master password isn’t a sequence of characters&mdash;it’s a set of pictures. We leverage your visual memory to keep your sensitive information secure. The images you learn comprise your master password, which is used to unlock your Valt.  Only you know your images so only you can unlock your Valt.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Download and launch the Valt app on your <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1275222446?pt=118339834&amp;ct=Valt%20Website&amp;mt=8">iPhone</a> or desktop <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/valt/id1276031931?pt=118339834&amp;ct=Valt%20Website&amp;mt=12">Mac</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Learn your secure master password by training on the images Valt shows you.</p></li>

<li><p>Test and reinforce your memory by selecting your images from the grids. There are 3 grids, and 3 of your images will appear on each grid. If you have any trouble we’ll help you by highlighting the images and retesting you until you’re ready to unlock your Valt on your own.</p></li>

<li><p>Unlock your Valt by selecting the images just as you did in Step 3.</p></li>

<li><p>Create new individual password entries by adding a title, username and password or <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/valt/id1276031931?pt=118339834&amp;ct=Valt%20Website&amp;mt=12">download the Mac app</a> and let us populate your Valt as you browse!
That’s it! When you return to your Valt later, from either your computer or mobile device, simply select your images to unlock your Valt.  All your passwords are now safely at your finger tips.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="can-valt-help-me-with-passwords-that-need-to-be-rotated-frequently">Can Valt help me with passwords that need to be rotated frequently?</h4>

<p>Yes! Each time you change a password in the browser, Valt will  suggest a new, unique and secure password to use on that site. Whether you choose to use the suggested password or would rather use one of your own, Valt will automatically update your entry with the new password.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-use-valt-on-my-android-phone">Can I use Valt on my Android phone?</h4>

<p>Right now Valt is only available for iOS users. We’re busy working on additional support but email us at <a href="mailto://feedback@valt.io">feedback@valt.io</a> if you’d like to be notified when it’s ready!</p>

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4 id="what-do-i-do-if-valt-on-my-mac-doesn-t-find-my-existing-valt">What do I do if Valt on my Mac doesn’t find my existing Valt?</h4>

<p>To use the Valt you created on your iPhone on your Mac (or vice versa) you must have iCloud enabled on your desktop computer. You can do this by going to System Preferences &gt; iCloud and confirming that “Drive” is checked.  If iCloud is enabled, please confirm that you are using the same iCloud account on both devices.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-get-valt-to-work-on-a-third-device">Can I get Valt to work on a third device?</h4>

<p>Right now Valt only supports syncing across your phone and a single Mac desktop. Support for authorizing additional devices is coming soon but feel free to shoot us a note at <a href="mailto://feedback@valt.io">feedback@valt.io</a> if you love Valt so much you want to use it on more than two devices so we can tell you the second it’s released!</p>

<h3 id="remembering-images">Remembering Images</h3>

<h4 id="how-many-images-do-i-have-to-remember">How many images do I have to remember?</h4>

<p>Right now every Valt is unlocked using 9 images (3 grids). Soon you’ll have the option to add an additional 6 images (2 more grids) for increased security.</p>

<h4 id="i-can-t-remember-so-many-images">I can’t remember so many images!</h4>

<p>Yes, you can! In fact, there are decades of academic research (including our own) that say you can easily recall hundreds of images, even without seeing them for a month.</p>

<h4 id="what-if-i-forget-my-images">What if I forget my images?</h4>

<p>Forgetting your images is extremely unlikely, but it is possible if you don’t use the app for a very long period of time. Unfortunately, there is currently no process for recovering password entries if all the images cannot be selected. We recommend refreshing your memory at least twice a week to prevent this from happening.</p>

<h3 id="security">Security</h3>

<h4 id="can-someone-get-my-passwords-if-they-have-my-phone">Can someone get my passwords if they have my phone?</h4>

<p>No. Even if someone has your device, they would have to correctly select all your images to display your passwords. Selecting your images without knowing them ahead of time is equivalent to you setting a random string of characters as your password and having someone guess that password correctly.</p>

<h4 id="should-i-worry-about-hackers">Should I worry about hackers?</h4>

<p>No. Your master password isn’t stored on a server; it’s in your memory, as a series of images. A hacker would have to ask you which images are included in your image set to gain access to your Valt.</p>

<h3 id="does-something-seem-odd-or-broken">Does something seem odd or broken?</h3>

<p>Tell us about it by sending an email to <a href="mailto://feedback@valt.io">feedback@valt.io</a>. Valt is still in its early stages and all the feedback we receive will help us to improve it.</p>

<h4 id="still-can-t-find-the-answer-to-your-question">Still can’t find the answer to your question?</h4>

<p>Send and email to <a href="mailto://feedback@valt.io">support@valt.io</a> and someone on the Valt team will help you get your question answered!
